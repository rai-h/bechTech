This app is just a simple leader board app which adds data to firestore and also fetchdata in realtime and display it on the home screen.


1. Scores are added to the leaderboard through a screen that takes the name of the game, a user name and the score. If a leaderboard for the game already exists, add the score to it.

2. Scores are stored on a per-game basis with a maximum of 10 scores per game.

3. The date and time that the score was added should also be stored automatically 

4. A user can exist in the same leaderboard more than once. E.g. they could hold the 2nd and 4th high scores

5. No authentication is required.

6. The UI should also allow a user to browse a list of games. The user can select a game to display the list of scores for that game
